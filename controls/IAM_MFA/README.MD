## Control Description
All users with an active password must have MFA enabled.

## Example Risk
An engineer reuses their password across multiple applications. Their Facebook password is compromised and a malicious actor logs into their AWS IAM user account using the compromised password.

## Required Evidence
* [credentials_report.csv](/evidence_library/IAM/credentials_report.csv) lists all users in your account and the status of their various credentials, including passwords and MFA devices.
  * This evidence is gathered by calling the [generate_credentials_report()](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/1.26.89/reference/services/iam/client/generate_credential_report.html) & [get_credentials_report()](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/1.26.89/reference/services/iam/client/get_credential_report.html) commands in Boto3.

## Testing Details
1. Open the [credentials_report.csv](/evidence_library/IAM/credentials_report.csv) and confirm that all users with an active password also have MFA enabled.
