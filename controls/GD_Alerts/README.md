## Control Description
GuardDuty is configured to send alerts to relevant personnel, for each in-scope region.

## Example Risk
A malicious actor compromised your AWS account and launches bitcoin miners at your company's expense. The new EC2 instances aren't discovered for 3 days and costs your organization $10,000.

## Required Evidence
* [allEventBridgeRules.json](/evidence_library/EventBridge/us-east-1/allEventBridgeRules.json) provides a list of all event bridge rules.
  * This evidence is gathered by calling the [list_rules()](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/events/client/list_rules.html) command in Boto 3.
* [guard_duty_alert_rule_targets.json](/evidence_library/EventBridge/us-east-1/guard_duty_alert_rule_targets.json) provides a list of targets for a specific rule. Note: This command is only called if the rule is ENABLED & it's source is GuardDuty.
  * This evidence is gathered by calling the [list_targets_by_rule()](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/events/client/list_targets_by_rule.html) command in Boto 3.
* [GuardDuty_to_Email.json](/evidence_library/SNS/us-east-1/GuardDuty_to_Email.json) provides a list of subscriptions for an SNS topic. Note: This command is called for all targets from the list_targets_by_rule command to identify what endpoints alerts are sent to.
  * This evidence is gathered by calling the [list_subscriptions_by_topic()](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/sns/client/list_subscriptions_by_topic.html) command in Boto 3.

## Testing Details
1. For each in-scope region, review the list of EventBridge rules and look for the following:
   determine that at least one rule is 'ENABLED' and is configured with 'GuardDuty' in the 'EventPattern' and has an appropriate pattern to pickup GuardDuty findings
2. Review the targets and relevant subscriptions to confirm that appropriate alerts are enabled (Email, Slack, etc).
